# Welcome to CS429!

This repo will serve as a resource for discussion material, and we hope you find it useful.
Each week will have a class review or demo set up for you to work on in groups, and answers will be released after all discussions are over.

# Solutions

Solutions will be posted on the solutions branch.
To pull them, create a new branch on your own repository with
`git checkout -b solutions`
`git pull origin solutions`
Then, you will be able to view the solutions while on the
solutions branch, and you can switch back to your own work with
`git checkout main`
This way, as long as you don't make changes on the solutions
branch, you won't get any merge conflicts when you try to pull
each week.

## Week 1: Basic Linux commands
## Week 2: C Examples
